# Simple Turtle Graphics

In this program, I demonstrated the use of the `turtle` or Turtle Graphics
module to draw shapes

## What I learned

`turtle` Graphics: Turtle graphics is a popular way for introducing programming
to kids. It was part of the original Logo programming language developed by
Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon in 1967.The turtle module
provides turtle graphics primitives, in both object-oriented and
procedure-oriented ways. Because it uses tkinter for the underlying graphics,
it needs a version of Python installed with Tk support.
